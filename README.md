# klangsynthese
Waveform and Audio Synthesis library in Go

This library is right now an idea. The goal of this library is to unify the following features with zero non-go-gettable dependencies:

- Loading and Saving audio files (.wav, .mp3, .flac, ...)
- Creating waveforms (Sin, Square, Saw, ...)
- Playing and Modifying audio samples
- Creating Sequences of audio samples to play music
